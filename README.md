# Country Info Manager 🌍

A simple **Python application** that demonstrates basic data handling and logic using country and data modules. This project provides a straightforward example of organizing code into multiple modules (`main.py`, `country.py`, and `data.py`) and running a small command-line program.

## 📂 Project Structure
Country-Info-Manager/
├── country.py # Handles country-related functions and logic
├── data.py # Stores or processes sample data for the program
└── main.py # Entry point to run the application

## 🚀 Features
- Organizes functionality into separate modules for clarity and reuse.
- Demonstrates basic data manipulation and control flow in Python.
- Simple and lightweight—ideal for beginners learning project structure.

## 🛠 Requirements
- **Python 3.8+**

## ▶️ Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tahmoores-Khoshnoud/Country-Info-Manager.git
📖 How It Works

data.py provides or manages the sample dataset.

country.py contains functions for processing or displaying country information.

main.py imports the modules and orchestrates the program flow.

🧩 Possible Extensions

Expand the dataset and add search/filter functionality.

Integrate external APIs for real-time country data.

Create a basic GUI or web interface using Tkinter or Flask.
